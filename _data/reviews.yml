- text: The weather was perfect, nice and sunny but not too hot. With close proximity to Carmel, we went to the beach and it was cloudy and cool, which is pretty normal weather this time of year. So if you want sunshine, the park is just far enough inland. The location is perfect with Carmel, Big Sur and Monterey near by.
