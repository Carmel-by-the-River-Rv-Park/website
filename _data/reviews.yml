Golfed 4 days with wonderful Jeff or Susan driving us to where we needed to go, including Carmel Valley Ranch (10 minutes away).  And Jeff helped with silly stuff we didn't know about RV's. Next time we'll rent one of the onsite RV's, and we will definitely be back!

Very nice place - quiet, pretty grounds, great pet area, etc. We would definitely recommend it and return!
